title: Track room availability from external calendars
description: If you already use Google Calendar, Tripleseat, Gather, or other software to manage room inventory, you may be able to share it with us.

If you already use another calendar or event management tool to keep track of room availability, you may be able to "link" the bookings from that tool with GamePlan.

### Requirements
- We can use any publicly-accessible URL that provides a standard calendar feed (.ics or iCal format)
- Each calendar feed should represent ONE room only
- Each event in the calendar should represent a time that should be unavailable to book via GamePlan

Here's how to find this link by your provider.

### Google Calendar
Sign into [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) with the account your room calendar is synced to.

Click the arrow next to the calendar containing the room's bookings and select **Calendar settings**.

In the **Private Address** section of the screen, click on the **ICAL** icon, copy the URL provided, and send it to your account manager.

### iCloud
1. Go to [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) and sign in with the account your calendar is synced to.
2. Go to the **Calendar** section.
3. On the left side of the screen, click the icon next to the name of the calendar you are tracking your room's availability in. This will open the **Calendar Sharing** popup, as shown below.
4. Check the **Public Calendar** box, copy the link provided, and send it to your account manager for further setup.
