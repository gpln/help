GamePlan is a group dining platform that provides venues an opportunity to market directly to large groups, especially focusing on the lucrative corporate market. We provide a new revenue stream while reducing the burden of planning and coordination on the venue staff.

### What you get

- Your own page on GamePlan to share group dining information like venue description, cuisine, tags, menu options, room configurations, and pictures.
- Confirmed bookings, not inquiries. Accept online reservations with room and menu details + credit card guarantee and/or deposit from the guest.

### How GamePlan works

- GamePlan follows your private dining rules: room fees, minimums, deposits, etc.
- No subscription, setup fee, or upfront cost - we get paid when you do.
- Billing goes through the GamePlan website and is paid out via Braintree in 2-3 business days. The final bill amount is submitted via the GamePlan Venue Portal when the party is complete.
- Once a guest books on GamePlan, you will have a 24-hour period to confirm the reservation, in case something was booked earlier that day or week.
- GamePlan will pass along the venue's contact information once the booking is complete. We encourage the party and/or venue to reach out to each other with any questions that GamePlan canâ€™t handle.
