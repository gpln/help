# Instant booking explained
## Reserve your space and meal online in an instant

Many of the experiences you find will have instant booking available. This means you can reserve your room, menu, and any addons for a specific time and number of guests immediately through our website. Availability is shown in real-time, so you can book with confidence knowing your party and event details are confirmed.

If you select a result without instant booking, we'll ask you for details about your event and coordinate your request with the restaurant. Availability may take up to 24 hours to confirm - your GamePlan concierge will keep you updated.
